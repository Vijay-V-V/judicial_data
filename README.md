# judicial_data
This work is an EDA on part of the judicial data provided by Development Data Lab (DDL).

## Process
1. We are provided with seperate csvs for cases from 2010-2018. Here we focus only on the year 2010.
2. The data provided by DDL is very large. The data in it's entirety almost comes upto 20GB. This can be very difficult and time-consuming to process. For that, we chunk our data smaller csvs. 
3. Now we process the data and explore it.
