# EDA on Judicial_data
This work is an EDA on part of the judicial data provided by Development Data Lab (DDL).

## Process
1. We are provided with seperate csvs for cases from 2010-2018. Here we focus only on the year 2010.
2. The data provided by DDL is very large. The data in it's entirety almost comes upto 20GB. This can be very difficult and time-consuming to process. For that, we chunk our data smaller csvs. The method is provided in the chunking.py file in the repository.
3. Now we process the data and explore it.
4. We look at some of the things which catch our eye as soon as we explore the data, like gender ratio.

The detailed work is provided in the jupyter notebook provided in the repository.
